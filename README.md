Hello! 
Payam-noor robocup is national wide competition in which students from different universities from different parts of Iran gather and compete in robotic competitions. The types of competitions range from soccer robots, soccer2d (simulation), soccer3d(simulation), routing robots, and etc.
This code I have written for war simulation section of this robocup. War simulation inculdes two characters fighting in 3d scene and the best and more precise charter to track and shoot will win this competition. In this competition, I won third place prize.
